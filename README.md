# vizad-woocommerce-empty
Wipe your WooCommerce products, variations and etc with one-click


This is a really simple plugin (I spent around 10 minutes developing it - just as a tool for other project), that allows the user to eliminate all WooCommerce data (Terms, Products, Variations and Categories). I decided not to eliminate attributes because it was not my intention. But you may use this plugin as reference for your plugin.
